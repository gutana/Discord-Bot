# Discord-Bot
Discord Bot that talks to League of Legends API to get player ranking information. 

This is an OLD PROJECT. I made it a couple of years ago with minimal programming experience at the time. Consequently, the code is really bad. I don't think it would even run in its present state. But, I have some sentimental attachments to this project, so here it is. 

Sample input: 

!rank (user)

Sample output:

(user) is in:
FLEX: GOLD IV 23 LP - 251 wins / 230 losses

SOLO: GOLD V 0 LP - 123 wins / 123 losses
